# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files:

- `correct.wav`: Sound played when a correct match is made
- `incorrect.wav`: Sound played when an incorrect match is made
- `win.wav`: Sound played when the game is completed

You can add your own sound files here. The game will work without them, but will display a warning message.
